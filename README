Limitations
-----------

SeaBIOS is open source software with functionality maintained by the
community. The BIOS is provided in Simics model packages to make the
models easier to use. The functionality of the BIOS is not guaranteed
by Wind River.

Build Environment
-----------------

Seabios is supposed to be buildable with recent versions of gcc and binutils.
Known good versions are gcc 5.1.1 and binutils 2.25-9

Compiling SeaBIOS
-----------------

The SeaBIOS tar-ball is distributed in the pub/ folder of the OSS Sources
package (#1020). Unpack the git repository:

  tar xjf <path>/seabios.tar.bz2
  cd seabios

Switch to the appropriate branch. For the x86-440bx model:

  git checkout 1.11-440bx

For the x86-x58-ich10 model:

  git checkout 1.11-x58-ich10

Or for the generic Simics bios:

  git checkout simics-1.11

Recent older versions can be checked out via their tag. Use "git tag"
to find the list of tags.

Build:

  make

To use the compiled bios, point $bios to <seabios>/out/bios.bin.
To use the compiled vgabios, point $vga_bios_image in the Simics target
scripts to <seabios>/out/vgabios.bin

More information can be found in the README.simics file in the git repository.

More information is located within the Git branch.

Debugging SeaBIOS
-----------------

Seabios outputs debug messages to port 0x402. A pc-config device
object is typically installed on that port, and you can enable logging
from that object through the log system with:

  log-level $system.motherboard.conf 4.

To pinpoint problems in the BIOS, a simple debug method is to add more
debug output in the BIOS. To do that, add dprintf statements (similar
to regular C printf) in the code and recompile. The first argument to
dprintf is the debug level, which you would normally set to 1 to get
the output on the debug port (0x402).

The symbol table to load in Simics or gdb-remote can be found in
<seabios>/out/rom.o. Since it is optimized code, it may be difficult
to do stacktrace, print local variables etc.
